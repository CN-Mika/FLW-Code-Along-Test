# FLW 01.4 // Code Along #1 // Using .style

Let's update the styling on this page so that the top half matches the bottom! We are only using JavaScript to make this happen!

## Code Along

Using .style and css properties:

First, change the background colors:

1. [ ] Set the `background` selector to a background color of black.
2. [ ] Set the `pink` selector to a background color of pink.
3. [ ] Set the `green` selector to a background color of green.
4. [ ] Set the `blue` selector to a background color of blue.
5. [ ] Set the `lightGreen` selector to a background color of lightGreen.
</br>
</br>

Next, let's focus on font:

6. [ ] Set the `row1` selector to have a font color of white.
</br>
</br>

Last, let's make the top a littttle different:

7. [ ] Using the `pink` selector, make the pink circle disappear! What css property and value do we use for this???
